# word_game

A grid view slowly fills up with letters.  The player must select letters
that combine to make works and submit.  Every letter that is successfully used in 
the creation of a word submission, gets removed from the grid. 

The object of the game is to make as many words as possible in order to keep the grid from
filling up. 

As the score increases, and time, the grid fill rate increases.
